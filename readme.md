# JorixOS
 This is my first attempt at creating an simple Operating System for educational purposes. I want to learn more about
 the fundamental concepts of computing technology, because of this I am doing several projects like writing an
 interpreter, compiler, web server, filesystem, this project and creating my own 8-bit computer composed of manny
 ttl chips, breadboards and _(an unnecessary amount to make it look more complicated)_ LED's.

## About
This project contains several components such as an bootloader, kernel and additional tools for building/running
the operating system. The bootloader is written in the NASM assembly flavor and the kernel is written in C and C++.
Some of the additional tools for build/run automation are written in Bash, Makefile and Python.

## Resources
Since its my fist real attempt to create an simple operating system, I have to learn a lot about almost every part
needed in OS development. I enjoy to lean and found that writing tutorials and documentation really helps in my learning
process. I think this is because explaining how, why and what your doing, uncovers if you really understand what and
more importantly why you are doing something. I am also constantly updating comments and documentation because I
learned some new stuff and see that I am describing incorrect behaviour or motivations.

Your free to take a look at my tutorials about NASM, OS development and Environment setup (I will probability add more),
but keep in mind that I am still learning and its very possible to encounter errors and I would appreciate any kind of
[feedback](https://github.com/jorisrietveld/Bootloaders/issues/new).

### Other Cool Projects
_While researching the subject of OS development I found several cool projects on GitHub that inspired me during
 the creation of my project._

- [:link: X86 Fuzzer, not related to OS dev but really cool)](https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/sandsifter) also watch a talk about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrksBdWcZgQ&t=1292s).
